# What I do

I'm usually involved in microbial ecology-related projects, including
developing software, performing analyses, writing manuscripts, and teaching
QIIME/microbial ecology workshops. I'm an active GitHub user; to see what I'm
up to, check out my profile: [@jrrideout](https://github.com/jrrideout).

Here's a few of the projects that I've been most recently involved in:

- [QIIME](http://www.qiime.org)
- [BIOM format](http://biom-format.org)
- [pyqi](http://bipy.github.io/pyqi)
- [My Microbes](http://my-microbes.qiime.org)

# What I'm interested in

Bioinformatics is a very new and rapidly growing field. In response to the
enormous influx of sequencing data over the past few years, there has been an
explosion in the sheer number of bioinformatics tools, file formats, protocols,
and techniques that are in use. In this extremely fast-paced environment,
quality is often sacrificed for quantity and immediate results. I firmly
believe that there is a strong need for the application of software engineering
"best practices" within bioinformatics in order to keep developers, users, and
maintainers sane, as well as to keep science and awesome research pushing
forward.

To this end, I'm interested in the application of techniques related to
automated testing, continuous integration, test-driven development, the code
review process, and release management *in order to make people's lives
easier*. I am also interested in thinking about ways of making our software
more accessible to users; how to take something that is very complex and
present it in such a way that it is intuitive, easy to use, and fun!

I'm also interested in addressing scalability issues within bioinformatics and
microbial ecology. Since the field is growing so rapidly and the amount of data
that programs have to deal with only continues to increase, many techniques and
tools quickly become obsolete or no longer scale to handle the size of modern
datasets. I'm interested in tackling these types of problems so that
researchers can continue to analyze their data in a timely fashion, and so that
bioinformatics can keep up with the deluge of incoming data.
