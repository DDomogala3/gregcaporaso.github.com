abstract: "I am a Masters student in Biology. I am interested in population genomics, ecology, remote sensing, and microbiology. For my thesis, I am working with the Nancy Johnson Lab to  incorporate novel bioinformatic techniques to elicit patterns of microbial communities in relation to nutrient and precipitation gradients for the Serengeti.

<p>In addition, I work with the Diablo Trust on the Integrated Monitoring for Sustainability project. The Landscape Conservation Initiative is collecting ecological, economical, and social data to determine the sustainability of grazing on high plains of northern Arizona. Specifically, I am creating a statistical model to analyze grazing impacts on Time Integrated NDVI (USGS MODIS product)."
