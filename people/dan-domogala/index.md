abstract: "I am studying the fish microbiome and I am focusing on large heterotrophic bacteria. Part of my project aims to analyze the effects of circadian shifts that occur in the fish microbiome community. Ribosomal 16s RNA sequences, clade members of the giant bacteria of interest have been recorded in surgeonfish and appear to be mainly restricted to these fish taxa. The geographic distribution of these fish seem to be from the Red Sea, Australia, the North and South Pacific Islands, and in butterfish from New Zealand.
 The large bacteria are restricted to the phylum Firmicutes, and is most closely related to Clostridium spp. and Metabacterium polyspora.
 I am hoping to further analyze the microbial ecology of the fish microbiome and how it relates to the presence of Epulopiscium spp. One major tool in my work will be using QIIME along with high throughput sequencing for an efficient and informative bioinformatics pipeline. "
