title: Flagstaff Microbiome
---

The long-term goal of the Flagstaff Microbiome Project (FMP) is to develop a long-term temporal microbiome sampling resource.   To date, longitudinal studies have focused only on one or a few individuals, sampled over a limited amount of time, or sampled infrequently.  We are currently in the beginning phase of the initial three-year study period, and we are developing an age/gender-stratified cohort of 1% of the population of Flagstaff, Arizona (approximately 700 subjects), who will donate monthly microbiome samples from five body sites.  This collection of samples will allow us to investigate factors associated with temporal dynamics in the human microbiome over a large population.  Data generated by the FMP will additionally be used to test hypotheses regarding specific genes and microbial species that may be keystone members of the microbiome, to be validated with qPCR.
