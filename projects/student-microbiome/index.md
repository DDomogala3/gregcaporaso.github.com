abstract: "The human microbiome, or the collection of microbes that live in and on our bodies are highly personalized. While any two human are typically greater than 99% identical in their genomic composition, they may share none of the same species of bacteria in their gut. At this stage we have very little understanding of the causes of this extreme variability in the human microbiome across individuals. In this study we surveyed microbial communities from approximately one hundred college students at three universities at four body sites (gut, palm of their hand, tongue, and forehead) weekly for ten weeks. By collected detailed information about their lifestyle, diet, and medical conditions via a questionnaire, we can generate data-supported hypotheses about the causes and types of variation in the human microbiome."

As part of this study, we provided students with a summary of their microbiome in the context of the microbiomes from all other participants. You can see an example of this summary on the <a href="http://my-microbes.qiime.org/">My Microbes</a> website.
