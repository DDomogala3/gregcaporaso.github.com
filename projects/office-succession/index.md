title: Office Succession
picture: "office-succession/profile.jpg"
abstract: "As North Americans we spend the vast majority of our time indoors. We know that microbial communities that cohabit our homes, offices, vehicles, and hospitals (among other indoor spaces), which typically harmless, under certain circumstances can have a negative impact on the health of building inhabitants. However at this stage we have very little understanding of environmental factors contribute to the establishment of certain microbial communities in the built environment. The goal of this project is to understand successional patterns in the establishment of fungal and bacterial communities in the built environment, specifically investigating the role of climate and surface material on the establishment of microbial communities on common office-building materials."

Two primary endpoints provide the motivation for this study. First, our study will elucidate the conditions that affect the establishment of microorganisms on office surfaces toward the goal of developing predictive models of what microbes will establish on different surface materials in different climates. This information could ultimately be applied to make decisions about what materials should or should not be used for building in certain climates to avoid the establishment of microbial communities which may pose human health or biodegradation risks. Second, we aim to understand the time-scale on which microbial communities establish and change in the indoor environment. This information is critical as we continue to move toward real-time monitoring of indoor microbial communities: to develop early warning systems of human health or biodegradation indicators it is critical to know how often to sample, and whether different materials, or the same material in different climates, must be sampled at different frequencies.
